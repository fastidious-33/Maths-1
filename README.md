Iterative methods for finding roots of an equations

Theoretical Maths was boring for me in high school , I decided to convert those repetative time consuming mathematical problems into coding shortcuts .

Maths is not just about getting the right answers but its the process , the journey

So I typed out problems which for which I could verify steps & answers also if possible visualize those answers in graphical form .

Also it did my make my homework easier .
